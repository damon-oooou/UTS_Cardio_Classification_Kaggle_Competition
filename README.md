# UTS FDA32130 Machine Learning Competition – Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
**Kaggle Competition Result: Top 33% (Rank 33/100 teams)**  


This project builds multiple machine learning classifiers to predict the “cardio” attribute in a structured medical dataset.  
The final predictions were submitted to Kaggle for real-time evaluation as part of the UTS FDA32130 competition.
